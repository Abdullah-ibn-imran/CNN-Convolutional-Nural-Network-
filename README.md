## Project Overview

This project implements a CNN to recognize handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark in the field of computer vision, is used for training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
